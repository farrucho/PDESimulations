<p id="description">This repository contains several 1D/2D simulations of partial differential equations (or briefly a PDE) using numerical techniques. At the moment there is an example implementation of the Finite Difference Method used in the wave equation with various boundary conditions, along with interactive gaussian pulses added in real time. My notes to this project along with the general FDE algorithm are in the notebook.pdf file.</p>

<h2>üç∞ How to run the simulations:</h2>

To run this project I recommend editing your *main.py* file and run the following

```python -i main.py```

Then proceed with the ```FullSolve()``` and ```startSimulation()``` or ```stopSimulation()```.
